# VibeWire - Quick Start Guide

Welcome to Team Cash Money's HCI project prototype! This guide will help you run the application on your computer.

## What You Need First

Before starting, you need to install two things:

1. **Node.js** 
   - Go to [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/)
   - Download and install the "LTS" version (The big green button)
   - Follow the installation steps with default options

2. **Visual Studio Code** (or any code editor you prefer)
   - Go to [Visual Studio Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
   - Download and install it

## Running the Project

1. **Get the Code**
   - Download or clone the project from the repository
   - Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code

2. **Install Project**
   - Open a terminal in Visual Studio Code (Top menu → Terminal → New Terminal)
   - Type this command:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   - Wait for it to finish (this might take a few minutes)

3. **Start the Project**
   - In the same terminal, type:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   - Wait for a message that shows the local address (usually `http://localhost:5173`)
   - Hold Ctrl (or Command on Mac) and click the link to open the project in your browser

## Troubleshooting

If something's not working:

1. **Make sure Node.js is installed**
   - Open a terminal
   - Type `node --version`
   - If you see an error, reinstall Node.js

2. **Try these steps if you have issues:**
   - Close Visual Studio Code
   - Delete the `node_modules` folder
   - Run `npm install` again
   - Run `npm run dev`

3. **Still not working?**
   - Check if you have the latest version of Node.js
   - Make sure you're in the correct project folder
   - Try closing and reopening your browser
