      <h3>Briefing</h3>
      <p>
        Hello! Thank you so much for taking the time to help us today. I’ll be
        walking you through this session. The goal is to explore some early
        ideas we’ve been working on through digital prototyping. Your feedback
        will help us improve the design and ensure we’re heading in the right
        direction. I’ll ask you to perform a few tasks using some designs that
        simulate what the actual product might look like. Think of it as a
        draft—it’s not finished, and that’s intentional. We want to catch issues
        before refining our website further, and hearing your thoughts as you
        interact with it will be incredibly valuable. There are no right or
        wrong answers. We’re testing the design, not you! If anything feels
        confusing or doesn’t work how you expect, that’s exactly the kind of
        feedback we need. Feel free to be honest with your opinions, even if
        something feels off or clunky. We’re not attached to any one idea, we
        are trying to improve. We’ll stay quiet while you explore. I might take
        notes or ask follow-up questions, but I won’t guide you unless needed.
        Before we begin, do you have any questions or concerns? Before we dive
        into the tasks, could you briefly introduce yourself?
      </p>

      <h3>Description of "Think Aloud"</h3>
      <p>
        To use the "think aloud" method for testing an interface, we will ask
        participants to verbally express their thoughts in our briefing, nudging
        them to do so throughout the tasks if they are going quiet. This
        provides insights into their thought processes and helps identify areas
        of confusion or delight. It will be more difficult to get feedback that
        is not necessarily positive since a programmed website seems more
        official than a paper prototype where things can be changed more easily
        and seems less professional. However, with choice prompts from the
        notetaker, it will be useful to get any feedback on the tasks. As
        participants navigate the interface, we will prompt them to vocalize
        everything that comes to mind - what they notice, what they expect to
        happen, and any challenges they encounter. Avoid intervening unless they
        become completely stuck. To set up screen and audio recording on the
        device the participant will use, we will screenrecord the device screen
        and their voice ensuring it captures the interface and their spoken
        thoughts. Zoom is a good recording program to do this on. Since the
        participants will most likely be anonymous we will not be recording
        their facial expressions, only their audio and the tested interface.
        Afterward, we will review the recordings to analyze the user's
        interactions, focusing on moments where they hesitate, express
        confusion, or find elements particularly intuitive or satisfying. This
        approach gives direct, real-time feedback on how users interact with the
        interface, highlighting areas for improvement.
